# ChristmasBot
### i was bored, so I wrote a christmas discord bot
This was just a really quick project that I wanted to do for my discord server, as many of us are stuck in isolation, I though it would be good to bring some festive cheer into the server. <br>
It really isn't my best code, or even code that I'm proud of, I just thought it would be fun, but, it's less than 100 lines! <br>
Merry Christmas!
